BY DOWNLOADING THIS HAVOK SOFTWARE, AND/OR INSTALLING OR OTHERWISE USING THE HAVOK SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO BE LEGALLY BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT (the “Agreement”).  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO DOWNLOAD OR USE THIS HAVOK SOFTWARE.

“Licensee”, “you” and “your” refers to the person who is downloading, installing or otherwise using the Havok Software provided under this Agreement.

“Havok” means Telekinesys Research Limited (trading as Havok) its affiliates and subsidiaries.  

“Target Platforms” means iOS, Android and Tizen.  Any other supported platforms will require a separate license from Havok.  Project Anarchy may be supported on platforms other than the Target Platforms, but no license to distribute on any platform other than the Target Platforms is granted hereunder.  Havok may add or remove Target Platforms upon written notice posted on www.projectanarchy.com.

“Licensee Applications” means applications and User Generated Materials (defined below) you develop using the Havok Software for entertainment or educational purposes only, intended for public release on an app store, and only for use on the Target Platforms.

The Havok Software is licensed, and not sold, and this Agreement confers no title or ownership to the Havok Software program or any copy thereof.  Any use, reproduction or redistribution of the Havok Software not in accordance with the terms of this Agreement is expressly prohibited.  All intellectual property rights in and to the Havok Software (including without limitation header files, libraries, demonstration code, sample levels, themes, objects, text, concepts, artwork, and other content incorporated therein) and title to any and all copies thereof are owned by Havok or its licensors.

Notwithstanding the above, you retain ownership rights in the Licensee Applications you develop.  Except for material that Havok licenses to you that may be incorporated into your own Licensee Applications, Havok does not claim ownership of your License Applications, and therefore, you remain fully responsible for it.  Havok does not control, verify, or endorse your License Applications that you and others develop.

2.  Limited Use License.  Subject to your continuing compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Havok hereby grants, and by installing, downloading or otherwise using the Havok Software, you thereby accept, a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sub-licensable limited right and license to install one (1) copy of the Havok Software solely for your use on a single computer in and in connection with the development of Licensee Applications on the Target Platforms.  You may not network the Havok Software or otherwise install it or use it on more than three computers at any one time.  The middleware components of the Havok Software are provided as components of the Havok Vision Engine and may not be extracted or otherwise used separately.  To use the Havok Software you must have all applicable or required hardware (which we do not provide).  You are responsible for paying all fees and taxes for any hardware and other costs (including without limitation internet costs) you may incur to access the Havok Software.  Neither this Agreement nor use of the Havok Software entitles you to any future releases of the Havok Software, or to any expansions, sequels, or similar or ancillary products.
Furthermore, in the event that you release a Licensee Application on a Target Platform which supports x86 based devices, you agree that you will also release an equivalent x86 compatible version of the Licensee Application.  For a comprehensive list of Target Platforms which have this requirement see www.projectanarchy.com/platform-requirements.

Educational Institutions Only: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in the limited case where students are using the Havok Software as part of an educational program in a computer laboratory environment or on educational institution owned computers and each student cannot install the Havok Software and accept this Agreement on an individual basis due to the institution’s rules and IT procedures, the educational institution may install the software on computers owned or operated by the institution for the use of the students, provided that it provides a copy of this Agreement to each student user in paper and/or electronic form and informs them that they are bound by the terms hereof.

3. User Generated Materials.

You may license, sell or otherwise make such User Generated Materials available to third parties, however the User Generated Materials will at all times be subject to and may not violate any term or condition of this Agreement (except that Section 6 (Attribution) shall not apply to User Generated Materials) or the terms and conditions of any third party license associated with the User Generated Materials.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a license will be required should you wish to develop or release User Generated Materials that act as a store, facilitate collection of revenue or provide direct means for purchasing materials within the Havok Software.  Please contact Havok via email at middleware@projectanarchy.com for licensing.
You may not express or imply that the User Generated Materials are in any way affiliated with or endorsed by Havok or its licensors.
